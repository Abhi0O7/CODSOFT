## Project Overview

Welcome to the Credit card fraud detection project repository. This project is dedicated to detecting fradulent transaction thus providing a basic insight to assist in detecting real time fraud transaction 

## Dataset

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle. It contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.
This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.
Features V1, V2, â€¦ V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, except the 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

1. **images/**: Contains images used within this README.
2. **Data/**: Stores the dataset used for analysis.
3. **README.md**: This document, gives an overview of the project.
6. **ipynb notebook/**: Contains a Jupyter notebook with the full co.
7. **saved model**: This is the final model.

## Project Dependencies

This project is developed using Python and relies on various libraries:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn
- Flask (for the web application)

Please ensure these libraries are installed or imported before running the code to avoid any errors.

## Project Workflow

The project followed a structured workflow:

1. **Data Preparation**: The dataset was meticulously cleaned and prepared to address missing values and ensure data quality.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: The dataset was explored through data visualization and analysis to uncover patterns and trends.
3. **Modeling**: Predictive models were built using machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, to predict sales based on advertising expenditures.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Models were assessed using various metrics, and the best-performing model was chosen.
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: The hyperparameters of the selected model were fine-tuned to enhance prediction accuracy.
6. **Insights and Recommendations**: Valuable insights were drawn from the analysis, and data-driven recommendations were offered to stakeholders.
7. **Conclusion and Next Steps**: The project's findings and key factors influencing sales were summarized, along with suggested actions for future marketing efforts.

## Results and Insights

The analysis of sales data led to several critical insights, including:

- Channel Effectiveness: TV advertising was identified as the most impactful channel for sales, with a significant positive correlation.

- Diminishing Returns: There's a point of diminishing returns for each advertising channel, emphasizing the need for an optimal budget allocation.

- Radio and Newspaper Distributions: Radio advertising spending is normally distributed and relatively evenly spread, making it a stable choice. Newspaper spending, on the other hand, exhibits positive skew, indicating less common high spending.

- Sales and TV Distributions: Sales data is symmetric, while TV advertising has a concentration of higher spending, suggesting the need for an in-depth analysis of high TV advertising expenditures.

## Conclusion and Next Steps

In conclusion, this project has illuminated the path to optimizing sales through data-driven insights. For future endeavors, consider the following steps:

1. **Allocate Budget Strategically**: Prioritize TV advertising for its substantial impact on sales. Allocate a significant budget portion to this channel.

2. **Monitor and Adjust**: Continuously monitor advertising performance and budget allocation to ensure alignment with sales goals.

3. **Diversify with Radio**: Explore radio advertising as a stable and less risky option to diversify your advertising portfolio.

4. **Caution with Newspaper Ads**: Approach newspaper advertising cautiously, especially high spending, as it may not significantly impact sales.

5. **Evaluate High TV Spending**: Investigate the effectiveness of high TV advertising spending to ensure it translates into increased sales.

6. **Data Collection**: Keep collecting and analyzing data to maintain accurate predictions in line with changing market dynamics.

7. **Customer Feedback**: Gather customer feedback to understand the impact of advertising on their purchasing decisions.

8. **Competitor Analysis**: Keep an eye on competitors' advertising strategies to refine your own strategy.

By implementing these steps, you can optimize your advertising budget allocation, increase sales, and maintain competitiveness in the market.
